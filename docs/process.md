# Fork the Repo

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Once your code is ready, you can propose your changes by making a pull request.

1. Sign in to your GitHub account and go to https://github.com/cinemaproject/monorepo
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

Now, you are in the copy of a repository. The path in the top-left corner changes from cinemaproject/monorepo to <your username>/monorepo. You can experiment here.
